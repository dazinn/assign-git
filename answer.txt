1. A gitignore file indicates which files should NOT be backed up to the repository. For a java project, it should include *.class, *.log, *.ctxt, .mtj.tmp/, *.jar, *.war, *.nar, *.ear, *.zip, *.tar.gz, *.rar, and hs_err_pid*.

2. In git, a fast-forward refers to a branch that can be merged into another branch without conflict. 

3. Different branches allow for different engineers to work on different (or the same) features simultaneously, and then merge their changes together in a branch separate from the master branch. This allows for merge conflicts to be found and fixed before they could make their way into master, and potentially break the code there. 

4. In a project there is usually just one remote repository, that everyone on the team clones into.
